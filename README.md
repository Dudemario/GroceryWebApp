## About the Project
As a group of incoming imcompetent freshman, we realized that we would inevitably be faced with the daunting task of shopping for ourselves. To assist ourselves in this process, we created a web app that enables the user to search for a product and receive results of local grocery stores with the ability to filter by price.Users then have the ability to add products to a shopping list that displays the total cost. There is also the ability to group by store on the shopping list page if desired.
